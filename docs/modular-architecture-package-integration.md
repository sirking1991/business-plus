# Modular Architecture Approach for Base Application and Composer Package Expansion

## 1. Base Application Structure
- The base app contains core modules (General Account, Receivables, Payables, Bank Reconciliation, Fixed Assets) and foundational services like User Management and Role & Permissions.
- Core modules are organized under a dedicated namespace and directory structure to isolate their concerns.
- The base app provides extension points such as service providers, event listeners, and middleware hooks for package integration.

## 2. Composer Package Development
- Each additional module (e.g., Sales Module) is developed as an independent composer package.
- Packages follow a standard structure with their own namespace, service providers, routes, views, migrations, and configuration files.
- Packages declare dependencies on the base app and other packages as needed via composer.json.

## 3. Package Registration and Discovery
- Packages register themselves with the base app by providing service providers that the base app auto-discovers or explicitly loads.
- Service providers handle binding services, registering routes, publishing assets, and loading migrations.
- The base app maintains a registry or configuration file listing installed packages for management and version control.

## 4. Integration Points
- Packages can extend or override base app functionality via events, hooks, or service container bindings.
- Shared interfaces and contracts are defined in the base app to ensure consistent interaction between core and package modules.
- Packages can define their own database migrations and seeders, which the base app runs during deployment.

## 5. Versioning and Dependency Management
- Composer handles package versioning and dependency resolution.
- The base app enforces compatibility constraints to prevent conflicts.
- Semantic versioning is recommended for packages to manage backward compatibility.

## 6. Security and Permissions
- Packages integrate with the base appâ€™s Role & Permissions system to define their own permissions.
- Access control middleware ensures package routes and APIs are protected according to assigned roles.

## 7. Deployment and Updates
- Packages can be installed, updated, or removed via composer commands.
- The base app provides CLI commands or UI tools to manage installed packages and their configurations.

## 8. Directory and Namespace Structure for Core Modules and Packages

### Core Modules Directory Structure
- Located under `app/Modules/` or `app/Core/Modules/` to clearly separate core business logic.
- Each module has its own subdirectory, e.g., `GeneralAccount/`, `Receivables/`, `Payables/`, `BankReconciliation/`, `FixedAssets/`.
- Inside each module directory:
  - `Controllers/` for HTTP controllers
  - `Models/` for Eloquent models or domain entities
  - `Services/` for business logic services
  - `Repositories/` for data access layers
  - `Database/` for migrations and seeders
  - `Routes/` for module-specific routes
  - `Resources/` for views, translations, and assets

### Namespace Conventions
- Base namespace: `App\Modules\<ModuleName>\`
- Example: `App\Modules\GeneralAccount\Controllers\JournalController`
- This clear namespace separation supports autoloading and modular development.

### Composer Package Structure
- Each package follows PSR-4 autoloading with its own namespace, e.g., `Vendor\SalesModule\`.
- Package directory structure mirrors core modules with `src/Controllers`, `src/Models`, `src/Services`, `database/migrations`, `resources/views`, etc.
- Packages include a service provider class for registration with the base app.

### Configuration and Assets
- Core modules and packages publish configuration files to `config/` and assets to `public/vendor/<package-name>/`.
- This separation ensures clean management and overrides.

This modular architecture enables scalable, maintainable, and extensible development, allowing new features to be added as composer packages without modifying the base application core.
